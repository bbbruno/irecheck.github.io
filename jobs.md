# PhD fellowship in Social Robotics for Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders
CHArt Laboratory from University Paris 8 is seeking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to contribute to the joint French-Swiss project iReCHeCk.

## Frame
iReCHeck is a French-Swiss project founded by ANR and FNS that involves the CHArt Laboratory, from Paris 8 University, the Children and Adolescents Psychiatry Service, from Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital and the CHILI Laboratory, from EPFL. Built upon the achievements of the Co-Writer Project, iReCheck aims at supporting children with severe handwriting difficulties (dysgraphia) by developing engaging training activities with a robotic co-learner.

## Context 
The PhD candidate will be member of the Human and Artificial Cognitions Laboratory, an interdisciplinary laboratory that federates the Paris 8 University, the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and the Paris-Est Créteil University. The aim of CHArt is bringing together researchers from cognitive sciences, psychology, mathematics and computer science in the study of natural and artificial cognitive systems.
While working in a tight collaboration with the iReCheck partners, the candidate will be part of the vibrant and passionate community of Paris 8 University: founded as the so-called “Experimental University Center of Vincennes”, issued from the historical University of Paris, Paris 8 University is pursuing excellence in humanities, human sciences, arts and social sciences since 1969. The main candidate’s working place will be the Campus Condorcet, located in the north suburbs of Paris.

## Tasks
The PhD candidate will work on the development and the deployment of engaging training activities based on the use of a social robot in learning-by-teaching scenarios. The development of such proactive and believable robotic partner will be achieved in the context of a close collaboration with CHILI Lab.
The PhD candidate will foster advances on the characterization of children’s behaviors, proposing in particular metrics, models, techniques and algorithms able to capture and to describe the behaviors of pupils in physiological terms as well as in terms of their motor and social abilities. 
The candidate will be called for working in a tight collaboration with the psychiatrists, the psychologists, the psychomotor therapists and the other practitioners from Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital, having the opportunity of deploying the proposed system in real scenarios involving children with neurodevelopmental deficits.

## Job requirements
* A master degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field;
* Knowledge and research experience in one or more of the following topics: Robotics, Planning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning;
* Past experiences in Statistics, Cognitive Sciences, Social Signal Processing and, more in general, computational analysis of human behaviors, are a plus;
* Interest in research in the area of robot-assisted therapy/education for children with special needs;
* Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English.

## Contract
* Fixed-term, doctoral contract 3 years;
* Starting day: latest before 1 October 2020;
* Monthly Gross salary: 1,769 euro.

## Applications
Applications will be considered until the position is filled. However, you are encouraged to apply early as we shall start processing the applications as and when they are received.

Applications, written in English, should be submitted online and should include:
* Curriculum Vitae (including your contact address, work experience, publications);
* Cover letter indicating your research interests and your motivation;
* Contact information for at least 2 referees.

Applications should be sent to: Salvatore Anzalone (sanzalone@univ-paris8.fr).
